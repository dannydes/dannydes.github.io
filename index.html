				<p>Daniel is a nature lover, web developer and vegetarian gym goer. When he doesn't have his eyes fixated on the computer screen, you can find him 
				taking care of his 3 tortoises and budgie, observing wildlife or hitting some "heavy" weights.</p>
				<p>Apart from his studies and work he has involved himself in several movements. During his studies at University, he was active in ICTSA's
				subcommittee particularly with a Science in the City 2014 project. In 2015, he joined the SHout campaign for the abolition of spring hunting through
				the unsuccessful referendum. Shortly after, he was elected to Y4TE's exec where he served for 6 months.</p>
