With regards to Dr. Muscat’s call to introduce gay marriage, we are happy the Prime Minister has woken up to the AD 2013 manifesto proposal.  We believe it is a step towards a more inclusive society.  In fact AD and ADŻ have always stated that equal rights in marriage is the way forward.

The strangest thing about the Prime Minister’s statement is that a few years back, in 2011 and in 2008 the very same perosn, Dr. Joseph Muscat, stated clearly on xarabank that he was against gay marriage.  How come he made such a big u-turn within such a short-time frame?

It seems strange that the Prime Minister proposed such an issue now, all of a sudden.  Given the timing, we feel that the LGBT community is being used to divert the conversation from the Panama-gate scandal.

If Dr. Muscat considered this issue so important, how come he did not propose this earlier?  What made him change his mind within these five years?
