The Ornis Commitee has recently recommended a spring hunting season despite turtle dove being marked
vulnerable by the ICUN.

Turtle dove population is in decline due to habitat loss, climate change AND HUNTING.

Spring hunting does not make sense since in spring turtle is on their way to breed, protected birds
are more statistically likely to be shot and the public is deprived of enjoying the countryside. Yet,
Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, has campaigned in favour of retaining the activity, while the PN has
avoided taking a position with Simon Busittil trying to appease hunters, reminding them of how much
he fought for them.
