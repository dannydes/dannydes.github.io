The Ornis Commitee has recently recommended a spring hunting season despite turtle dove being marked
vulnerable by the ICUN.

Turtle dove population is in decline due to habitat loss, climate change and hunting.

Spring hunting does not make sense since in spring turtle doves are on their way to breed.  Protected birds are more statistically likely to be shot and the public is deprived of enjoying the countryside.

Yet, Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, has campaigned in favour of retaining the activity, while Simon Busuttil has also taken a position in favour of spring hunting, thus trying to appease hunters.

Our message is clear: Stop Spring hunting
