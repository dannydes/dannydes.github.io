Falzon being accused of Gaffarena connections is old news and nobody can deny  
the PN too has a past with Gaffarena so I am in no way saying the past government 
was any better.

Upon his resignation, Falzon is trying to shift the blame by portraying the 
auditor's report as political vengence. Give us a break!

One should also keep the following in mind:

* This resignation comes 6 months late due to the proceedings of the investigation in question.
* If Falzon is being accused for someone else's wrong-doings, he has had more than enough 
chance to say so.
* Pullicino Orlando, the very same person stamped by Sant, was present to PL's standing ovation 
to the saintly Michael Falzon.
