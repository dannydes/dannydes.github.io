Falzon being accused of Gaffarena connections is old news and nobody can deny  
the PN too has a past with Gaffarena so I am in no way saying the past government 
was any better.

Upon his resignation, Falzon is trying to shift the blame by portraying the 
auditor's report as political vendication. Give us a break!

One should also keep the following in mind:

* This resignation comes 6 months late due to the proceedings of the investigation in question.
* If Falzon is being accused for someone else's wrong-doings, he has had more than enough 
chance to say so.
* Pullicino Orlando, who formerly received so much critism by Labour, was present to PL's
standing ovation to the saintly Michael Falzon.

So much for Muscat's bluff about cleaning up his party!
