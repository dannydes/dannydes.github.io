Last Friday, TV show, Xarabank has issued 3 Emy Awards for public figures and I am doing the same 
- only this time, I'll mention my top 10. So lets start.

## Sai Mizzi - Energy Minister Konrad Mizzi's wife
Although not being a politician herself, it's quite obvious her position is a result of nepotism 
and that she'll never conclude deal with any telecom company - not without a phone in her office.

## Austin Gatt - Former Transport Minister
Thanks to his deal with Arriva in the past legislation, bus service in the south has been further
 neglected, appart from the Zurrieq district with the "70ijiet tieghek".

## Roderick Galdies - Parliamentary Secretary for Hunting and Trapping
He has some nerve to relex laws regarding hunting and trapping and then claim otherwise.

## Norman Lowell - Imperium Europa Leader
Being a far-rightist with weird cosmic philosophies, this guy will never escape my black books or
 better-said my pea book.

## David Casa - PN MEP
Voting in favour of emissions and then defending his vote by calling the Greens unrespectful does
 not exactly earn him any honour. If anything, he's also the laziest amongst our MEPs.

## Joe Mizzi - Transport Minister
His reform has done more harm than good - seriously just resign!

## Mario Calleja - Marsascala Mayor
we should just be thankful to him for giving away Zonqor for an extra rest room - that could turn
 out useful.

## Ivan Grech Mintoff - Alleanza Bidla Leader
His ultra-conservative insights, Eurosceptism and scaremongering around the introduction of 
abortion is all there is in his electoral programme.

## Michael Falzon - Former Parliamentary Seceratary for Development of Concrete Jungles
whining about a report being against him, attacking the NAO and jouranalists does not make you 
think this guy is much of gentleman as his colleuge described him. He could be in person but 
definitely not in politics.

## Joe Muscat - Prime Salesman
Poor acting skills as shown in his New Year message make you question how this guy could be that 
popular a salesman but he has managed to capatilise on anything imaginable - from pieces of land 
to Schengen passports.
