It's encouraging to see Marsascala's local council oppose the Munxar proposal.

It seems like the mayor wasn't offered any rest room works as was the case with Sadeen's proposed hotel in Zonqor.

Although this opposition is welcome, lets not forget the decision taken by the majority of councillors whereby they 
were more interested in pleasing their master over protecting what little countryside is left.
