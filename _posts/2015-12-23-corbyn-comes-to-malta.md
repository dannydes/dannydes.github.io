Newly appointed UK Labour leader has [just paid our country a visit](http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20151223/local/jeremy-corbyn-in-malta-on-private-visit.596675#.VnqyEA-jCQc.facebook) 
and what's more he has used EasyJet! That's one kind of a politician.

He was then greeted by the Office of the Prime Minister - perhaps he will teach our Premier a thing or two about socialism.
