Yesterday morning, we (L.A.N.D. - Living Ability Not Disability) have payed a visit to the Malta 
Falconry Centre in Siggiewi, where we could take a close look at the birds of prey in captivity.

The path to the birds' homes is riddled with labels describing the species of plants and insects 
living there.

The peregrine falcon is the first raptor one would encounter here, being commonly known as the 
Maltese Falcon due to its connection to Maltese history. This falcon often feeds on smaller birds 
and reaches speeds of over 300 miles per hour!
