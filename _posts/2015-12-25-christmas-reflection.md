The feast of Christmas is back upon us and the usual ritual of celebrations and expensive 
presents follows.

To brighten things up, there are still [people doing their utmost to help vulnerable 
people in our society](http://netnews.com.mt/news/kollox-lest-ghall-ikla-ghal-min-mghandux-fjum-il-milied/).
It is nice to celebrate but this time of the year should also serve 
as a time to reflect on both yourself and those who surround you - followed by our country 
and the world out there.

It's time for change - put some time into helping other people, animals, our environment, our 
society in general.. It doesn't take much to make a difference.

I wish you a Christmas full of love and joy!
